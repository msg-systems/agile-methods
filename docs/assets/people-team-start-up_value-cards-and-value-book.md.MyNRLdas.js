Afterwards, the facilitator draws a flipchart with two categories:<ul><li><strong>Core Values</strong></li><li><strong>Wish Values</strong></li></ul> Each team member is invited to post his/her own values to the two different categories on the flipchart and open up for a value-based discussion. After everyone has done this, the facilitator invites the team to write down its first &#39;Team value book&#39;.<br> The left book page has the title <strong>&#39;Team Values&#39;</strong> and the right book page is called <strong>&#39;What do we need to fulfill/live them?&#39;</strong>. The team is allowed to agree on <strong>ten</strong> values for each book page. At the end, the facilitator asks the team for feedback about the value discussion.<br></p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flipchart/whiteboard, sticky notes, cards</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The values for the team may change during the project.
