This method is named after the &quot;<strong>C</strong>entrum voor de <strong>O</strong>ntwikkeling van het <strong>C</strong>reatief <strong>D</strong>enken&quot;, the Dutch centre for the development of creative thinking.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This method provides a good visualization of a complex world with complex ideas. This method supports the agile team in planning its product roadmap in both the short-term and long-term. The team brainstorms and sketches a clear picture of the features and releases they have to deal with in the future. The product owner can also prioritize the product backlog and the product roadmap together with the stakeholders/sponsors by using the COCD box. This ensures that the organisation&#39;s primary focus is on delivering value to customers.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The use of this method gives the team a good overview of which of the many ideas collected should be pursued and which can be discarded.</p><h2 id="benefit" tabindex="-1">Benefit <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This method requires almost no preparation, can be completed within 30 minutes and is very easy to carry out.</p><h2 id="procedure" tabindex="-1">Procedure <a class="header-anchor" href="#procedure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Procedure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This activity usually starts with a presentation of the context of the project and the ideas, then the facilitator draws the COCD box on a flipchart/whiteboard. It consists of four quadrants (fields):<br> The vertical axis contains the fields <strong>feasible</strong> and <strong>not (yet) feasible</strong>.<br> The horizontal axis contains the fields <strong>common ideas</strong> and <strong>original ideas</strong>.<br> Ideas that are very original and easy to implement, i.e. those that are real <strong>WOW</strong> ideas, are the most important and valuable. Dont&#39;t forget to explain the quadrants to your participants. <br>Each participant receives a jointly defined number of stickers (e.g., two per color) to select their favorites. Then, the group scores points together and selects the favorites from the mass of ideas, whereby the moderator makes sure that the participants submit their points &quot;uninfluenced&quot; (they do not deliberately wait until others have scored first in order to &quot;save their points&quot;). Then, all the ideas that have received points are grouped in the three categories of the COCD box. <br> If the team only has one or two WOW ideas and they&#39;re only affecting the fringes of your business, take a look at the <strong>NOW</strong> ideas next. These are those that are easy to implement, but have only a low degree of originality and therefore may soon lose their appeal. You should tackle these now. Finally, deal with the <strong>HOW</strong> ideas. These are the ideas with a high degree of originality, but which are difficult to implement or which the team does not yet know how to implement. Keep these ideas with all the material you have already collected during the creative activity. You can then bring up the HOW ideas at the next creative session. You will have a better idea of how to realize these original ideas.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Whiteboard/flipchart, markers, yellow, blue and red stickers</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This method can be used either alone or in a group.
