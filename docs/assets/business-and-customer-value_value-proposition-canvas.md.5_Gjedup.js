This means that it is best to develop your own value proposition canvas for each customer group or persona. You look at each target group from three perspectives: customer jobs, pains and gains.<br> After you have described the needs and expectations of your customer group, you now start systematically <strong>on the left side</strong> of the Value Proposition Canvas to develop your value proposition against the problems, pain and gains of your customers. In order to do this, you also have to work out three questions: products and services, pain relievers, profit generators.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The performance or value proposition is the central element in the business model of an organization/team. The systematic development of the value proposition is the basis for an organization&#39;s marketing, pricing and subsequent success in the market. The Value Proposition Canvas is the ideal tool for a company to systematically address its own value proposition.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Applying this methodology will result in a value proposition that properly addresses the needs of your customers.</p><h2 id="benefit" tabindex="-1">Benefit <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When working with a team, the VPC is first and foremost a communication tool.

Download the Value Proposition Canvas and print it in A1 or A2. Make sure you have enough sticky notes and pens. Decide on the first customer segment you want to work on. If you are working in a team, you can form groups and work on customer groups separately. Work systematically through the value proposition canvas in each area. Allow 10-15 minutes per area, depending on the size of the group. Also critically review which assumptions about the customer&#39;s jobs, pains and gains are based on experience, observation or interviews. Validate the problem/solution fit.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Value Proposition Canvas, sticky notes, pens, flipchart/whiteboard</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Align your value proposition with the results of your user/customer research.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Strategyzer AG <a href="https://assets.strategyzer.com/assets/resources/the-value-proposition-canvas.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Value Proposition Canvas</a>,Alexander Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Gregory Bernarda, Alan Smith (2014) &#39;Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want (Strategyzer)&#39;, Wiley,Alexander Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur (2010) &#39;Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers (Strategyzer)&#39;, Wiley</p>',19),f=JSON.parse('{"title":"Value Proposition Canvas","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"business-and-customer-value/value-proposition-canvas.md","filePath":"business-and-customer-value/value-proposition-canvas.md"}'),h={name:"business-and-customer-value/value-proposition-canvas.md"},g=Object.assign(h,{setup(p){return(c,d)=>(i(),o("div",null,[l,t(a,{subject:"Business and customer value",participants:"Stakeholders/managers, the entire team",facilitator:"Agile Coach / Agile Master"}),u]))}});export{f as __pageData,g as default};
