It has to be made visible, what initial amount of work was planned and how much of it was completed by the end of the sprint. You can also print or draw the cumulative flowchart of the last sprint, showing how much work is still in progress, how much has been completed, how much is still open, and how much is blocked. These categories can be personalized for each team (e.g. using the tool Jira Atlassian). Depending on the team&#39;s sprint results, the Agile Master writes down the following questions on the flipchart or whiteboard:<ul><li> Why did we not achieve the amount of work we committed to in the last planning?</li><li> What might be the main reasons?</li><li> What can we do to be more successful in achieving our sprint goals?</li></ul></p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Whiteboard/flipchart, sticky notes</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It is important to involve each team member in discussing the questions.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/cumulative-flow-diagram-938845656.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Atlassian Jira - Velocity chart, Cumulative Flow Diagram</a></p>',19),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Sprint Metrics Check","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"structure-and-processes/sprint-metrics-check.md","filePath":"structure-and-processes/sprint-metrics-check.md"}'),l={name:"structure-and-processes/sprint-metrics-check.md"},g=Object.assign(l,{setup(m){return(d,p)=>(o(),a("div",null,[c,i(t,{subject:"Inspect and Adapt / Retrospective",participants:"The entire agile team",facilitator:"Agile coach / Agile master"}),h]))}});export{b as __pageData,g as default};
