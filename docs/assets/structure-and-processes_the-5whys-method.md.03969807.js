Using this method, you try to get to the root of the problem step by step by asking &quot;why&quot; questions, assuming that several causal relationships are intertwined. After asking the question five times, you will usually have found the cause. This method is also called &quot;Root Cause Analysis&quot; and was invented by Saichi Toyoda, founder of the car manufacturer Toyota.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This technique recognises assumptions or the skipping of intermediate steps and interrupts the usual way of dealing with problems.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The 5-Why method shows a cause-effect relationship of a problem.</p><h2 id="benefit" tabindex="-1">Benefit <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This method is not only easy as well as quick to learn and apply. It also encourages teamwork and forces the individual to keep an eye on the whole process. This sharpens the individual&#39;s view of relationships. Usually you want to solve a problem as quickly as possible - without further ado, but also without questioning. Writing down the steps in the &quot;5 Whys&quot; method requires clear questions and answers.</p><h2 id="procedure" tabindex="-1">Procedure <a class="header-anchor" href="#procedure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Procedure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The facilitator empowers the team/audience to describe the problem in as much detail as possible. The more facts you gather, the faster you will get to the root of the problem. What is the difficulty? When did it first occur and how often? Who discovered it and what were the consequences? Avoid assuming - you can only end up jumping to the wrong conclusion. To get a sense of the causal relationship, gradually ask the &quot;why&quot; questions. This works in many areas of the company, in production as well as in everyday life.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Whiteboard/flipchart</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The key challenge is to ensure that the real reason (the right &#39;why&#39;) is articulated. This requires joined-up thinking. It is therefore important to be consistent in trying to capture the real reasons. To do this, it may be necessary to consult other data or people.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Rüegg, K. &amp; Vetterli, C.
