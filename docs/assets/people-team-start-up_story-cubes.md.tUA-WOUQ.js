When it is a player&#39;s turn, he/she rolls the dice. Then he/she has to try to tell a story that reasonably links all the symbols rolled - that&#39;s it. There is no winner or loser, but there are plenty of colorful stories. New combinations of the 54 symbols always result in new stories. You can decide about the amount of the dice for each story. For example, the facilitator can ask each team member to roll the dices once, afterwards choose four dices and make up a story about the last sprint, using the symbols available.<br> In another variation of the game you can include the complete team. For each story use the number of dice as you have players/team members. The player who roled the dice starts with the story, the next player takes the next die of his choice and creates the next part of the story.<br></p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Set of Story dice / Story cubes</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This game is not only to create content during e.g. a Retro, a very important goal of this game is team building. <br> To get an appropriate set of story dice / story cubes, any set you can find in a toy store is fine.
