The different thinking and solution strategies also promote more efficient cooperation in the future.

The trainer describes the situation and the people in which the teams should empathize. Indiana Jones is on the run from natives with three researchers. The research group has a lead of exactly sixty minutes. During this time, they have to cross a fragile suspension bridge in extreme darkness. However, they only have one flashlight and there can be a maximum of two people on the bridge at a time. Indiana Jones covers the distance in five minutes, one of the researchers in ten minutes, the other two in twenty and respectively twenty-five minutes. <br>After this story, the trainer sets the task to the teams:<br>In which order do which couples have to cross the suspension bridge and who brings back the flashlight so that they can escape in time?<br> The solution is: Group of two/way there: 5+10 minutes, back: 5 (or 10) minutes, group of two/way there: 20+25 minutes, back: 10 (or 5) minutes, group of two/way there: 5+10 minutes.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Small groups / paper and pens</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Agile Coach / Agile Master should keep in mind the Tuckman&#39;s phases of team building and support the team accordingly.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p>S.
