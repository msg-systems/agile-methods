In general, there can be many occasions and triggers for change management. The need to change arises in very different areas of a company. Change projects are initiated when the company has reached a strategic turning point, when it is innovative, introduces new technologies, needs to save costs, suddenly experiences strong competition or needs a cultural change or even a change in leadership styles. We live in a time in which technologies, markets and working methods are changing rapidly. The reasons for this can partly be found in the unbelievably fast development in the IT area.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Participants exchange stories and opinions on change.

Questions make contemplate certain things and often into topics that we don&#39;t want to discuss or things that we&#39;ve been avoiding or trying to ignore. Participants are asked to cluster in small groups and to answer the questions from the given cards. They have to tell their change experiences/stories to the other participants and implicitly raise awareness for their decision taking and way of dealing with the change.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flipchart/whiteboard, printed change management game and cards or <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/change-management-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">template on miro board</a></p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The question cards might also be helpful in retrospectives.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://management30.com/practice/change-management-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Management 3.0: &quot;Change Management Game&quot;</a></p>',19),f=JSON.parse('{"title":"Change Management Game","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"structure-and-processes/change-management-game.md","filePath":"structure-and-processes/change-management-game.md"}'),l={name:"structure-and-processes/change-management-game.md"},b=Object.assign(l,{setup(m){return(d,g)=>(r(),t("div",null,[h,n(a,{subject:"Leadership",participants:"Managers, stakeholders, Product Owners, agile coaches, HR department, board members (optional) and every person that has a leadership role",facilitator:"Agile coach / Agile master"}),c]))}});export{f as __pageData,b as default};
