When people identify a certain threat to their existence, their territory or habits, they adopt a panic mode and will try to fight, flee or they may freeze.</p><h2 id="definition" tabindex="-1">Definition <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Definition&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The name lizard brain is related to that panic reactions that are taking place in the so called part of our brains which we call the amygdala, which can be found just above the brainstem in all vertebrates. We share the amygdala with all mammals, birds and — as the name implies — with lizards. The amygdala in fact cancels rational thought by disconnecting the upper brain functions.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This model helps understand why people behave irrationally during an agile change or transformation process.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Understanding the behavior of team members and all stakeholders helps to take the right actions, both preventive and remedial.</p><h2 id="benefit" tabindex="-1">Benefit <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The agile roles must be defined very clearly, so that people can work well together on the same goals.

A loss of their decision power. They are forced to make their work transparent. <br> <strong>Existence:</strong> Scrum/Agile can be a threat to one&#39;s existence within the organization (Specialists who are not so special anymore). <br> <strong>Fight:</strong> Direct or indirect attacks. Offensive behavior during scrum meetings. Radiate fear, uncertainty, doubt etc. <br> <strong>Flee:</strong> Some people move to other teams or leave the company, as soon they hear that agile will be implemented. <br> <strong>Freeze:</strong> Many people become paralyzed and unable to produce anything valuable for months.<br><img src="'+l+'" alt=""> <br> [<a href="https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2013/11/29/change-what-is-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source: agile42.com</a>]</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flipchart / Whiteboard</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The behavior may change from one reaction to another e.g. first freeze then fight.
