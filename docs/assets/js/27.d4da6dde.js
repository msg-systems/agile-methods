In the middle of the canvas, you will find the "Goals & Mission" field. Here, you write down the purpose of the role. If you cannot state any goals for the role, you should seriously ask yourself whether the role is even needed. On the right, you will find the primary tasks. Note the primary activities of the role here. Be careful not to get into too much details. In the "Responsible and Decides" field, note what this role is responsible for and where and when it has to make decisions. Right next to it, you will find the "NO" field. Here you see what the person in this role shouldn\'t do. This helps to clearly delimit the role to be defined. The "Tools" field is located between the "Mission and Primary Tasks" fields. Describe role-specific communication channels, communication tools and work equipment here. In the "Support" field, note from whom the role needs support from or who the role actively supports. Proceed in a similar manner in the field of information transfer: Describe with whom the role should share its knowledge and when, and how the exchange of information is regulated. But also make a note from whom the role receives or should receive information from and when. Finally, there remains one more field "Notes". This joker field is a placeholder for anything that does not fit into the other categories.
