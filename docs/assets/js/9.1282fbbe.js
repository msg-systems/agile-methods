It consists of four quadrants (fields). The vertical axis contains the fields "feasible" and "not (yet) feasible". The horizontal axis contains the fields "common ideas" and "original ideas". Ideas that are very original and easy to implement, i.e. those that are real "WOW" ideas, are the most important and valuable. If the team only has one or two WOW ideas and they\'re only affecting the fringes of your business, take a look at the "NOW" ideas next. These are those that are easy to implement, but have only a low degree of originality and therefore may soon lose their appeal. You should tackle these now. Finally, deal with the "HOW" ideas. Those are the ideas with a high degree of originality, but which are difficult to implement or for which the team does not yet know how to implement them. You keep these ideas with all the material that you have already accumulated during the creative activity. You can then bring up the HOW ideas at the next creative session. They then will already recognize more how you can realize these original ideas. Each participant receives a jointly defined number of glue dots (e.g., two per each color) to select their favorites. Then, the group scores points together and selects the favorites from the mass of ideas, whereby the moderator makes sure that the participants submit their points "uninfluenced" (they do not deliberately wait until others have scored first in order to "save their points"). Then, all the ideas that have received points are grouped in the three categories of the COCD box.
