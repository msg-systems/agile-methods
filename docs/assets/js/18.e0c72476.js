They are to be considered in their interaction. If one component is insufficient, it cannot be compensated for by the other components. Agile leadership has to stand on four legs. The HAVE model can be divided into two categories. Modesty and commitment represent the interpersonal components in agile leadership. Modesty is more related to inner demeanor and engagement to outer demeanor. The team feels the humility of the leader. The team, however, can visualize and hear a leader's commitment. Adaptability and visionary explain the task-related component of agile leadership. The decision creates a culture of togetherness and cooperation. It forms the basis for a focus on target achievement and the flexibility that an agile team needs to have to react to changes. Modesty opens the way for others to get the best out of themselves and others and thus to realize the potential of ideas and knowledge of employees. With commitment, he/she builds on the culture that an agile leader has created through his/her modesty. He/she leaves the \"fixed\" desk and seeks conversation and exchange with others. He/she notices which new trends are appearing, what are the issues that concern the market, customers and employees. At the same time he/she builds networks and includes their environment in his/her considerations. The speed of change and thus the disruption of a large number of business areas requires the ability to adapt. It is important to constantly realign yourself. The availability of real-time information changes yesterday's decisions. Adaptability here means changing one's mind, revising decisions. Leading agile means being responsive to changing circumstances. Thinking and acting in a visionary manner provides inspiration and orientation. The inspiring aspect of a vision creates energy and motivation. The orientation that the vision provides directs this energy in the right direction and motivates people to achieve their goals and corporate goals.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"motivation"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#motivation"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Motivation")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("It becomes very clear why the inner attitude, mindset of a manager/leader is so essential.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"procedure"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#procedure"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Procedure")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The HAVE model can be developed in the form of a 4-hour workshop.
