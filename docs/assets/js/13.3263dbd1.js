Alternative flow: Description of the variant or the optional behavior as part of a narrative use case. Story: By using a story, the user gets the option to use a valuable system. In Use Case 2.0, a story is described by the narrative use case, one or several flows, requirements and one or several test cases. A story is in consequence not identical to a user story from Scrum. Use case model: A use case model consists mainly of a number of actors and use cases, as well as diagrams that visualize their relationships. Use case slice: A use case slice unites one or more stories that are selected from a use case and represent a unique value for users. Rules for defining use case slices: Use case slices have to be cut so small that they can be implemented in one sprint. The first use case story is called basic flow. It will be implemented first.
