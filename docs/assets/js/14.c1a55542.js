The systematic elaboration of the performance promise is the basis for an organization's marketing, pricing and subsequent success in the market. And the Value Proposition Canvas is the ideal tool to systematically entertain a company with its own value proposition. The Value Proposition Canvas is divided into two areas. On the right side you are looking at a selected customer segment. On the left side you compare your value proposition and show in detail how your value proposition addresses the needs of your customers. On the right side, you are only looking at a selected customer segment. This means that it is best to develop your own value proposition canvas for each customer group or persona. You look at each target group from three perspectives: customer jobs, pains und gains. After you have described the needs and expectations of your customer group, you now start systematically on the left side of the Value Proposition Canvas to develop your value proposition against the problems, pain and gains of your customers. To do this, you also work out three questions: products and services, pain relievers, gain creators.
