Each number signifies a different level of delegation. 1 corresponds to "announce": The manager only informs the team about the decision. 2 means "sell": Here, the manager decides, but tries to convince the team that the decision is correct. At level 3 "question", the manager seeks advice from the team before making a decision. At level 4 "agree", the team and manager try to find a compromise. From level 5 "advice" on, the balance shifts in the other direction: Here, the manager advises, but the team decides. At level 6 "inquire", the team makes the decision, but the manager enquires the result. Finally, level 7 corresponds to "delegating", where the team decides completely autonomously. Before the start of the game, the team contemplates team-relevant scenarios in which decisions have to be made, such as about the development of the project design, the hiring of new team members or other topics. Each player then quietly thinks about which delegation level he/she would choose when making this decision. When all players have reached a decision, the cards are revealed. The players with the highest and lowest values each justify their decision. The objective is to find a compromise in the (time-restricted) discussion and to play again in a further round until an aligned result is achieved and the next scenario can be played. The results can be recorded in writing, on a "delegation board", for example.
