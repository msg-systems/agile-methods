Territory: Scrum/Agile working can be a threat to one's territory. A loss of their decision power. They are forced to make their work transparent. Existence: Scrum/Agile can be a threat to one's existence within the organization (Specialists who are not so special anymore). Fight: Direct or indirect attacks. Offensive behavior during scrum meetings. Radiate fear, uncertainty, doubt etc. Flee: Some people move to other teams or leave the company, as soon they hear that agile will be implemented.
