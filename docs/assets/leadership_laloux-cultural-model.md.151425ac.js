If he/she is not strong enough, the risk emerges that someone else from the crowd will topple him/her. These organizations are very unstable. (Examples: Mafia, street gangs).<br><strong>The Amber organization</strong> form is characterized by having many rules about what is correct and what is wrong. People have a common belief and exercise self-discipline to fit perfectly into this organization with its specific rules. These organizations are extremely stable and everything is kind of certain. Stable rituals and processes make life predictable for everyone. <br><strong>The Orange organizations</strong> are like real &quot;machines&quot;, focused on being smarter, better, more innovative in manipulating the world, achieving success, profit, market share etc. These organizations are very contemporary and dominate today&#39;s management views. They are marked by materialism as a key value. <br><strong>The Green organizations</strong> are called &quot;families&quot;, where everyone has a place, where colleagues take care of each other, where the happiness of every member is important to the organization&#39;s overall success. The key values of this organizational behavior are: Empowerment of people, a value-driven culture and stakeholder value. <br><strong>The Teal organization</strong> is the last level of this model. Many people who shift to a teal perspective start to feel pain and emptiness in the actual modern life, where they have separated very much of their true nature. They want to get back the inner voice of their soul. People miss the wholeness. In this form of organizations, people shift from an external to an internal decision-making. As a consequence, ego is left out and also the need to control things and to fit in.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our world is changing very fast. It is a profoundly new view of the world, one that opens radical new possibilities.

The facilitator then invites every participant to reflect about the following aspects:<br>&quot;Are your activities as a manager aimed more at satisfying your own ego or at recognizing the overall system?&quot;<br> &quot;Who are the stakeholders in your work? Try to identify as many stakeholders as possible: Who is interested? Who has influence? Who is affected?&quot;<br> &quot;Which organization form from the Laloux Cultural Model would you assign your department to?&quot;<br> &quot;What is the paradigm of your company? Which paradigm is worth striving for?&quot; <br>After the participants have written down their notes, the facilitator invites them to share their thoughts with the entire group. The group will then identify together to what paradigm of the cultural model their organization fits best and will gather some action items / solutions in order to achieve the desired/ideal organization form.<br><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flipchart / whiteboard</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The boundaries between the dfferent kinds of organizations may have smooth trasitions.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Jc5aAJu9g/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Frederic Laloux: Reinventing organizations</a><br><a href="https://www.humanizingwork.com/laloux-cultural-model-and-agile-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Laloux Cultural Model and Agile Adoption</a></p>',19),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Laloux Cultural Model","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"leadership/laloux-cultural-model.md"}'),d={name:"leadership/laloux-cultural-model.md"},w=Object.assign(d,{setup(c){return(m,p)=>(t(),o("div",null,[h,r(a,{subject:"Leadership",participants:"Agile Coach / Agile Master, stakeholders / managers, the entire team",facilitator:"Agile Coach / Agile Master"}),u]))}});export{b as __pageData,w as default};
