The goal is explained to the teams and the backlog, DoD and NFR&#39;s are presented. Each entry in the backlog represents a page in the bound booklet to be created. Time keeping is an essential feature of the game. The teams have four minutes to choose their task(s) for their first sprint as well as planing the sprint. A sprint lasts only ten minutes. The goal is to meet the DoD. The agile coach/master should not intervene with advice. The facts that the agile coach should make transparent in the end, are related to the following aspects:<ul><li>coordination among the teams (e.g., on the animals that share the same page color)</li><li>how was the communication among the teams</li><li>were they able to agree on some issues</li><li>the continuous integration of features (pages for the zoo guide)</li><li>the integration of the features only at the end</li><li> cross-team dependencies</li><li>what new roles were found within the teams</li></ul></p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Multi-colored paper, tables for the teams, pens, a folder with three hole binding and a transparent cover, three hole punch, a Definition of Done on flipchart, a predefined product backlog in the form of requirement cards, non-functional requirements also written on cards</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This game is particularly useful if you are just about to start using a scaling framework such as Nexus.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Don McGreal (2016): <a href="https://www.tastycupcakes.org/2016/07/nexus-zoo-a-scaling-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;Nexus Zoo (a scaling simulator)&quot;</a> TastyCupcakes.org</p>',19),g=JSON.parse('{"title":"Nexus Zoo","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"structure-and-processes/nexus-zoo.md"}'),c={name:"structure-and-processes/nexus-zoo.md"},b=Object.assign(c,{setup(d){return(u,p)=>(t(),o("div",null,[l,i(a,{subject:"Processes / Scaling agile",participants:"At least 3 agile teams consisting of 3-9 people",facilitator:"Agile coach / Agile master"}),h]))}});export{g as __pageData,b as default};
