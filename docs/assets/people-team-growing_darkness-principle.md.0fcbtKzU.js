This follows from the &quot;Darkness Principle&quot;.</p><h2 id="definition" tabindex="-1">Definition <a class="header-anchor" href="#definition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Definition&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The &quot;Darkness Principle&quot; states that each agent in a system is ignorant of the behavior of the system as a whole. If an agent &#39;knew&#39; the entire system, all the complexity of the entire system would have to present in that agent [Cilliers: 1998:4-5]. As a consequence, each team member possesses only a partial and incomplete mental model of the entire project. That&#39;s the reason behind a common planning and decision making. Scrum and Extreme Programming are fully applying this model by requesting the entire team to be present during daily stand-ups and Scrum planning meetings. Managers often feel that they lose control if the teams decide together and often without them. Any actions to control teams, don&#39;t work long-term and lead to team&#39;s demotivation.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Motivation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Increases self-organization of agile teams and organizations.</p><h2 id="results" tabindex="-1">Results <a class="header-anchor" href="#results" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Results&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A motivated and self-organized team where every member is aware of all the things and interactions that happen within the team.</p><h2 id="benefit" tabindex="-1">Benefit <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Nobody in an organization or a team has a complete view of all the things that happen. If teams are allowed to solve their problems and to make decisions together and by themselves, the manager / the organization actually increases the control over the situation from a positive perspective. The &quot;Darkness Principle&quot; makes it transparent that the manager has to delegate the micromanagement to the agile team.</p><h2 id="procedure" tabindex="-1">Procedure <a class="header-anchor" href="#procedure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Procedure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The &quot;Darkness Principle&quot; can be introduced as an open discussion in teams, workshops with the management and stakeholders and also within the organization. Best practices have shown that summarizing the &quot;Darkness Principle&quot; with some keywords written on a wall in the team spaces, makes it more transparent and easier to remember. It is also visually available to everyone in the organization and is a good method to bring people back to the core of the agile process.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flipchart / Whiteboard or as a free conversation, Decision Poker, Delegation Poker</p><h2 id="hints" tabindex="-1">Hints <a class="header-anchor" href="#hints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Keeping the theory of the JoHari Window in mind, you know that not everyone - including yourself - shares all available knowledge or information.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1">See also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;See also&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Jurgen Appelo &#39;Management 3.0 Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders&#39;</p>',19),f=JSON.parse('{"title":"The Darkness Principle","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people-team-growing/darkness-principle.md","filePath":"people-team-growing/darkness-principle.md"}'),m={name:"people-team-growing/darkness-principle.md"},k=Object.assign(m,{setup(d){return(c,p)=>(r(),t("div",null,[l,o(a,{subject:"Empower people / the agile organization",participants:"Stakeholders / managers (optional), the entire agile team",facilitator:"Agile Coach / Agile Master"}),h]))}});export{f as __pageData,k as default};
